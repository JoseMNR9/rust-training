# Space Age

This is an interactive program in Rust that calculates someone's age in Earth years and in years of other planets in the solar system, given the seconds since birth.

## Use

1. Run the program.
2. Enter the number of seconds since birth.
3. Enter the name of the planet on which you want to calculate the age (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, or Neptune).
4. The program will calculate and display the person's age in Earth years and in years of the selected planet.

## Example

```bash
$ cargo run

Enter the number of seconds:
$ 1000000000
Enter the planet (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, or Neptune):
$ Jupiter
Age on Jupiter is 1.68 Earth years
```
